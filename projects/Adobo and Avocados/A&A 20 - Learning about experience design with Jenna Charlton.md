Guest:: 

## Checklist

- [x] Contact the guest and tell them about Adobo and Avocados.
	> Hi <guest>! How are you doing? I wanted to ask if you'd be interested in being our future guest in our podcast/livestream called Adobo and Avocados? You can find our past episodes [here](https://www.youtube.com/@adoboandavocados/streams). Our aim is to have a platform where we feature amazing people in tech as well as those from underrepresented groups. We can talk about your career in tech or, if you have other important topics in mind, we can also discuss those.

	> Adobo and Avocados is an hour-long live conversation that is streamed to the [Adobo and Avocados YouTube channel](https://youtube.com//@adoboandavocados). It's very casual, and you can share unique experiences working in tech! 
- [x] If the guest agrees, choose a date for the Office Hours session. Confirm the time and ask them for a photo you can use for promotion, or ask for permission to use their profile pic on social media.
- [x] Invite them to the Adobo and Avocados calendar invite (choose "this instance only", not the whole series). Change the invite to include the episode number and their name, ie `Adobo and Avocados #01 with Rafaela`. This is to save the date. Schedule the invite for 15 minutes before the stream (to do a tech check) until 15 minutes after the stream (to debrief). The invite should be for 1.5 hours.
- [ ] Create a thumbnail on [Canva](https://canva.com) using the Adobo and Avocados thumbnail format. Use [thumbsup.tv](https://thumbsup.tv) to check how the thumbnail looks on different devices.
- [ ] Schedule the broadcast on [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com), and select the Adobo and Avocados YouTube channel as the destination.
	- [ ] In the title, include the instance of Adobo and Avocados, i.e. `Getting started in testing with Rafaela Azevedo (A&A #2)`.
	- [ ] Add the standard description as per previous Adobo and Avocados shows. Check the video description and add guests' contact details.
- [ ] Get the Streamyard invite link and put it in the "location" of the calendar invite to the guest.
- [ ] Get the YouTube link to the show. Put the link on this page, in the URL property above.

### Just before the show

> Here are some points to discuss with the guest in the 15 minutes before the stream begins.

- [ ] How do you pronounce your name?
- [ ] What are your pronouns?
- [ ] We will be using the talking points, but we don't have to be strict about it. We don't have to go through all of them, or follow a specific order. They're only there to make us comfortable.
- [ ] Does anyone want to share their screen? We can do that now, and I can show you how that works
- [ ] We'll be streaming to YouTube.
- [ ] You'll be able to see comments, but if you have links, I have to paste it into the private chat.
- [ ] You can also use the private chat if you need to say something, but you can also just say it out loud.
- [ ] If at any point you aren't comfortable talking about something, please either say so or let me know in the private chat, and I'll pivot away from that topic.
- [ ] Afterwards, we'll say goodbye to the stream, but please stay on past that so we can debrief.
- [ ] Just in case I disconnect... stall for a minute and I'll be right back.

## After the show

- [ ] Add any links shared to the description of the video.
