Guest:: Joseph (Joe) Elliot

## Checklist

- [x] Contact the guest and tell them about Office Hours.
	> At Grafana Labs, we do a weekly livestream called [Grafana Office Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk7NoagbJ28&list=PLDGkOdUX1Ujrrse-cdj20RRah9hyHdxBu), where we have guests on to talk about how to use Grafana, observability, or visualization. I saw your [blog post/video/post] on [source] and I think it would be great to have you on the show to share your experience about [topic].
	Office Hours is an hour-long live conversation that is streamed to the [Grafana YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@grafana). It's very casual, and you can also share your screen if you'd like to do a demo (not required). If you'd like to join, I'd love to have you! 
- [x] If the guest agrees, choose a date for the Office Hours session. Confirm the time: 13:00 UTC (15:00 CEST) on Friday. Ask them for a photo you can use for promotion, or ask for permission to use their profile pic on social media.
- [x] Invite them to the Grafana Office Hours calendar invite (choose "this instance only", not the whole series). Change the invite to include the episode number and their name, ie `Grafana Office Hours #01 with Mitch`. This is to save the date. Schedule the invite for 15 minutes before the stream (to do a tech check) until 15 minutes after the stream (to debrief). The invite should be for 1.5 hours.
- [x] Create a thumbnail on [Canva](https://canva.com) using the Grafana Office Hours thumbnail format. Use [thumbsup.tv](https://thumbsup.tv) to check how the thumbnail looks on different devices.
- [x] Schedule the broadcast on [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com), and select the Grafana YouTube channel as the destination.
	- [x] In the title, include the instance of Office Hours, i.e. `What's new in Grafana 10? (Grafana Office Hours #01)`.
	- [x] Add the standard description as per previous Grafana Office Hours shows. Check the video description and add guests' contact details.
- [x] Get the Streamyard invite link and put it in the "location" of the calendar invite to the guest.
- [x] Get the YouTube link to the show. Put the link on this page, in the URL property above.
- [x] Create an event and announce it [on the Grafana Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/grafana-friends-virtual-meetup-group/).
- [x] Schedule a tweet just when the show begins to say "We're live now!"
- [x] Schedule a Slack message on the internal Grafana workspace (in `#community`).
- [x] Schedule a Slack message on the public Grafana Slack workspace (in `#announcements`)

## Talking points

> Enumerate talking points for the show. It's better to keep these as bullet points to encourage a more casual, rather than scripted, conversation.

- Intro
	- *Hello and welcome to Grafana Office Hours. I'm `<name>`, a `<position>` at Grafana Labs and today, we're going to talk about `<topic>`.*
- Announcements
	- Lisa's video on *Grafana, Observability, & DevOps*: https://youtu.be/4-z1-eEHhvs
	- Café con Grafana yesterday with Raúl Marin (in spanish): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irUr96JV-Sg
- Introduce guest: Joe Elliot
	- Who are you?
	- What do you do?
	- How long have you been using Grafana/other project?
- What is distributed tracing?
	- Tracing is an observability signal that tracks a series of events throughout your system
	- History of tracing
		- Google published a photo on Dapr
		- Zipkin - b3 (Big Brother Bird)
		- Jaeger (Uber)
			- Baggage, and existed in OpenTelemetry
		- Tempo
	- Basic tracing concepts
		- Define: trace, span, context propagation
		- How does tracing work?
	- Why should we do distributed tracing?
	- One of the misses in open source tracing: focused on looking at a single trace instead of looking at how things are connected
	- How is it different from metrics and logs?
		- What don't metrics and logs cover that traces do?
			- Metrics: good for aggregations, bad for fine-grained information - correlative information
			- Logs: good for revealing what happened sequentially in one application or across applications, but bad at showing how a single request behaves inside a service
			- Traces: causative relationship/information
		- Known problems vs. issues with unknown causes
	- How is it different from continuous profiling?
		- Tracing is done at a high level but about one specific transaction
		- Continuous profiling is sampled over time, aggregated over many transactions
	- The more distributed an application is, the more unpredictable its failure modes become.
	- What does tracing have to do with OpenTelemetry?
		- There are intrinsic fields in a span, and one of them is "error/ok/unset". (Also `kind`)
	- What is instrumentation? Why do applications need to be instrumented?
- What is Tempo?
	- History of Tempo
		- Tom Wilkie asked Joe to determine if we could do hosted Jaeger. We wanted a distributed tracing thing
		- He decided that Jaeger wasn't the right path, so he made a large key value store that stored OTel traces.
		- After a year, it was extremely cheap to run but it didn't do enough. Integration with logs and exemplars didn't quite work.
		- Added Parquet? backend, added TraceQL
		- Goal: Sample 100% of read path, scale Cassandra and Elastic
	- How is Tempo different from other tracing backends? (Key features)
		- scalability
		- integration with other tools in the Grafana Labs stack
	- What is TraceQL?
		- Prometheus is based around the concept of streams. They're all strings, all key value pairs. Loki is the same.
			- This is not sufficient to support a trace query.
		- OTel supports numbers, strings, arrays, maps, maps of arrays of maps of strings
		- More pipe-based than PromQL
- Walk us through it: we have an application. How do we start seeing traces with Tempo? (demo?)
	- Client instrumentation (automatic or manual)
		- Easiest: OpenTelemetry
			- Jaeger deprecated their own clients and told people to use OTel too
		- Depends on language - Java: jar file. .NET he thinks is similar. Go has less magic
		- Reason why tracing is harder than the other signals: all components need to be instrumented. Really needs everything instrumented before it can provide value.
		- Traditionally ebPF can't do tracing
			- Context propagation has to happen from the application layer
	- (Optional) Set up tracing pipeline (ex: Agent) / collector
		- OTel collector is more generic and more extensible
		- Agent is more opinionated
	- Deploy and configure Tempo: Docker Compose, Helm, Tanka
	- Visualize (ex: Grafana)
	- Alerting
- Cool feature: remote sampling
	- Most people do head sampling: Give me 5% of my traces
		- Make a choice at the start of tracing
		- Simplest form of sampling
	- Tail sampling: create the entire trace and then choose whether to drop it or not
		- Cost: memory and CPU because it's all in the buffer.
		- Commonly used for traces that take >10 seconds
		- Another disadvantage: the backend would then contain a skewed or biased version of traces
	- Remote sampling (OTel and Jaeger both do it, Zipkin doesn't): centrally control a JSON document that says for every endpoint, sample them at these rates
		- more unbiased than tail sampling
- Best practices for setting up distributed tracing
- Relationship between distributed tracing and performance testing
	- Grafana Cloud k6 Tempo integration
- Plans for the future
	- distributed tracing for frontend?
	- Adding metrics to traces?
- Outro
	- If people want to learn more about this topic, where should they go?

### Just before the show

> Here are some points to discuss with the guest in the 15 minutes before the stream begins.

- [x] How do you pronounce your name?
- [ ] What are your pronouns?
- [ ] We will be using the talking points, but we don't have to be strict about it. We don't have to go through all of them, or follow a specific order. They're only there to make us comfortable.
- [x] Does anyone want to share their screen? We can do that now, and I can show you how that works
- [ ] We'll be streaming to YouTube.
- [ ] You'll be able to see comments, but if you have links, I have to paste it into the private chat.
- [ ] You can also use the private chat if you need to say something, but you can also just say it out loud.
- [ ] If at any point you aren't comfortable talking about something, please either say so or let me know in the private chat, and I'll pivot away from that topic.
- [ ] Afterwards, we'll say goodbye to the stream, but please stay on past that so we can debrief.
- [x] Just in case I disconnect... stall for a minute and I'll be right back.

## After the show

- [ ] Add timestamps to the video (at least four).
- [ ] Add any links shared to the description of the video.
- [ ] Add the video to video playlists that make sense (at the very least, the "Grafana Office Hours" one.)
