## Videos

- Community calls
	- Need to be in Live section to separate conversations vs. pre-edited
	- Need to have better thumbnails
- Video thumbnails that are colour-coded, with product logo prominently displayed
- Titles should always have product name (ex: K-SIX news doesn't say k6)
- Playlists should be by product (not just community calls)
- Content
	- We should have content *around* our projects, not just about them.
- Consistency across video metadata
	- standardized video description with the same set of links
	- No tags
	- Descriptive titles
	- Better thumbnails
- Everything over 5 minutes should be timestamped
- Pinned comments
